## Overview

The aim was to build a full-stack application with a React frontend and a Django back-end implementing RESTful API to serve all CRUD routes. This application reuses public survey data from Stack Overflow to present detailed results for each developer's tool. Python program is applied to iterate through the original CSV file and calculate the number of votes assigned to a particular branch and developers tool. The program converts Python native objects into JSON objects and saves the output into a new seed file. Data visualisation components are powered with the graphing library - Plotly.js, which combines the selection of bar and pie charts. The app uses register/ login authentication to validate requests for network resources. An authenticated user can create their profile with the collection of favourite tools and share their profile details with the rest of the community.
